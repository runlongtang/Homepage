<p id="h.p_D07SFdOCAz5n">My name is Runlong Tang. I have a deep understanding of statistical methodologies and theories, especially on linear regression models, generalized linear models, shape-restricted nonparametric estimation, kernel smoothing, penalized estimation, and meta-analysis. I have been enhancing my understanding and practice of statistical / machine learning methods since they are really useful at least for prediction. Now I am very familiar with CART and random forests from ideas to algorithms to software. I am highly skilled in R and Fortran 90 and have been improving my skills in Python, C, and SAS. </p>
<p>Currently, I am very interested in statistical applications. I would like to solve real-world problems by applying and developing useful  statistical / machine learning methods. By the way, I am always interested in statiscal methodologies and theories. <a href="notes/notes.html" target="_self">Here</a> is a list of my notes on methods, theories, software for computation and documentation, and data analysis. <a href="data_sets/data_sets.html" target="_self">Here</a> is a list of my notes on data sets.</p>
<p>This is my main website. I also have a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tangrunlong">google homepage</a> and a <a href="https://rltangblog.wordpress.com/">wordpress blog</a>, both of which will not be updated. The reason is that it is fun to use Git with GitHub.</p>
