<p id="h.p_D07SFdOCAz5n">My name is Runlong Tang. I have a deep understanding of statistical methodologies and theories, especially on linear regression models, generalized linear models, shape-restricted nonparametric estimation, kernel smoothing, penalized estimation, and meta-analysis. I have been enhancing my understanding and practice of statistical / machine learning methods since I feel that they are really useful, at least for prediction. Now I am very familiar with CART and random forests from ideas to algorithms to software. I am highly skilled in R and Fortran 90 and have been improving my coding skills in Python, C, and SAS. </p>
<p>Currently, I am very interested in real data analysis and statistical applications. I would like to solve real-world problems by applying and developing useful  statistical / machine learning methods. It is also worth to note that I am always interested in statiscal methodologies and theories. In fact, invaluable are good general methods and theoreis, such as the maximum likelihood estimation, likelihood ratio tests and their theories, bootstrapping, penalized estimation, and random forests. <a href="notes/notes.html" target="_self">Here</a> is a list of my notes on methods, theories, software for computation and documentation, and data analysis. <a href="data_sets/data_sets.html" target="_self">Here</a> is a list of my notes on data sets.</p>
<p>This is my main website. I also have a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tangrunlong">google homepage</a> and a <a href="https://rltangblog.wordpress.com/">wordpress blog</a>, both of which will not be updated. The reason is that it is fun to use Git with GitHub.</p>
