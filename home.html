<p id="h.p_D07SFdOCAz5n">My name is Runlong Tang. I have a deep understanding of statistical methodologies and theories, especially on shape-restricted nonparameteric estimation, kernel smoothing, penalized estimation, and meta-analysis. I not only have a deep understanding of statistical / machine learning methods but also can do effective and efficient programming for computation with languages such as R, Fortran, Python, C, and SAS.</p>
<p>Currently, I am interested in statistical applications on finance since I can understand well real-world problems about financial markets, investments, derivatives and credit scoring. I would like to solve real-world problems related to financial risks by developing useful, efficient, and innovative statistical / machine learning methods with powerful computational technology. <a href="notes/notes.html">Here</a> is a list of my notes on Finance, methods, various software for computation and documentation, and data analysis.</p>
<p>This is my main homepage. I also have a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tangrunlong">google homepage</a> and a <a href="https://rltangblog.wordpress.com/">wordpress blog</a>, both of which will only be used as archives but not be updated. The reason is that I'd like to use Git with GitHub.</p>
