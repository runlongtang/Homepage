<p>Leo Breiman is one of the four inventors of CART (classification and regression tree) and the inventor of random forests. There is an <a href="http://videolectures.net/ecml03_breiman_teapb/">online video</a> of Leo Breiman giving a talk at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases in 2003. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this talk, Leo Breiman first talked about CART. Then, after briefly pointing out several disadvantages of CART, he talked about random forests, many good things about random forests. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leo Breiman's ending words are interesting. He said random forests was &quot;the kind of tool that is needed for real scientific exploration&quot;. This means he thought random forests should be used as a default practical tool (at least for classification). However, he pointed out a phenomenon that once people (data analysts) &quot;have a model, something like random forests, they start to think it's the absolute truth&quot;. Then, he emphasized the real truth was that &quot;<span class="important_words">all a model can give is an educated computer guess</span>&quot;. So, one should &quot;always be suspicious&quot; about his or her model and &quot;<span class="important_words">use human intelligence</span>&quot;. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In these days, phrases like AI (artificial intelligence), deep learning, and machine learning are super hot. There is even an emerging science called Data Science. I think the main reason is that methods from AI research and machine learning are beginning to play a role in people's daily life. I also think perhaps in several decades Data Science will become as real and solid as Computer Science. However, Leo Breiman's warning perhaps would always hold true. All AI, deep learning, machine learning, and Data Science can give us is &quot;an educated computer guess&quot;. We should always need to use our human intelligence, especially on important issues. How to use our human intelligence with AI? It is an open question to be explored. I think, as an initial step, we should try to have a deep understanding of both what the real problems are and how the computer guess is educated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I want to point out another interesting thing. The most important or creative element of CART is their pruning procedure, which is in fact quite complex, really not easy to understand all the details clearly. However, in random forests, Leo Breiman use fully grown trees without pruning at all. This means, in random forests, Leo Breiman remove the most creative element of CART all together. <span class="important_words">So, a procedure might be helpful for one method but harmful for another. It is meaningless to talk about how good or bad a procedure is without a context.</span> CART, random forests and the pruning procedure provides an excellent example. However, Leo Breiman's suggestion of using full trees in random forests is based on his rich experience, his personal rich experience. There is no formal theory for this suggestion. So, perhaps for certain data sets, it might be better to use slightly pruned trees. That is, we should not take Leo Breiman's suggestion as the ultimate truth, though we should usually follow his suggestion.</p>
