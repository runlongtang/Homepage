<p>This paper reports some promising results on predicting the increase or decrease of the next mid-price change of a stock given a history of limit order books. The proposed method is the so-called universal deep learning model which is trained on a pooled data of the order flows and transactions for about 500 stocks. The network for the universal deep learning model has 3 layers of long short-term memory (LSTM) units.</p>
<p>The good thing about this paper is that it tells us deep learning with LSTM performs well in predicting the increase or decrease of the next mid-price change of a stock. This finding should be of great interest in high-frequency trading.</p>
<p>However, this paper lacks details of the proposed method. A deep learning method usually has some tuning parameters. It is usually important to clearly explain how these parameters are chosen. Also, for the optimization, it is also important to explicitly describe how the initial values are set and what is the stopping rule. Perhaps such information has commercial value and the authors do not want to reveal it. It is understandable. However,  such a shortage of details inevitably reduces the scientific value of the paper.</p>
