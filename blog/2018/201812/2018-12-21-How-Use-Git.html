<h2>How to Use Git: An Example</h2>

<p>I wrote a simple tutorial (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/crygom8pmu2hptp/How_to_use_git_pub.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">PDF</a>) on how to use Git with a lot of screenshots. The tutorial just contains an example with details. For the basic idea of Git, you can read Pro Git by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. Now I think Git is useful. I guess one with some knowledge about Linux and command lines can learn the basics in a couple of days. So, I strongly recommend people who use computers to write something learn to use Git. You don&rsquo;t have to be a programmer to use Git. Both Git and Linux were created by <a title="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus Torvalds</a>, interesting. He really made some difference.</p>
