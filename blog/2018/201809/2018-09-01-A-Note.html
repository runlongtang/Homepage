<p>The 2017 report <a href="http://valuesimplex.com/articles/JPM.pdf">Big Data and AI Strategies</a> by Kolanovic and Krishnamachari provides a very good introduction to data collection and machine learning for Finance. Before reading this report, I did not know there were already so many data companies. I recommend anyone doing quantitative works on finance read this report.</p>
