<p>鲁迅自己曾说过：&ldquo;我所想的和我所写的不一样&rdquo;，&ldquo;我为自己写作和为他人写作是不一样的&rdquo;。【钱理群：怎样才能读懂鲁迅】</p>
<p>Lu Xun (鲁迅) (1881～1936) perhaps is the most important and famous Chinese writer of the 20th century, at least after 1918 when he wrote his first fiction &ldquo;A Madman&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; in spoken Chinese (白话 <em>baihua</em>). Mao Zedong (毛泽东) in 1940 even claimed &ldquo;Lu Xun&rsquo;s direction is/should be the direction of new Chinese culture.&rdquo; Although an important reason for Mao Zedong&rsquo;s extremely high praise of Lu Xun is to use Lu Xun&rsquo;s great influence on people, especially those young students with a dream of building a great new China, as a powerful weapon  against the government led by Jiang Jieshi (蒋介石), Mao Zedong indeed admired Lu Xun&rsquo;s deep insights and profound thoughts and his complete dedication to the goodness of common Chinese people. I think Lu Xun was at the peak of moral high ground in his time so that he could almost always defeat his enemies, most of whom were flunkeys of the government or other foreign powers, in all kinds of debates on social issues and had never really been challenged.  Unfortunately, however, after Mao Zedong seized the highest political power of China, he somehow began to turn around to interrupt Lu Xun&rsquo;s direction and finally almost completely destroyed it. This is really an ultimately bad luck for the nation, if it is not inevitable. Not only Mao Zedong should be blamed, but also most of other political leaders and the Chinese people, who were actually still &ldquo;old&rdquo; Chinese though they were in the so-called &ldquo;new&rdquo; China.</p>
<p>People praised Lu Xun to the skies even when he was alive for believing that he was capable of finding the truth (about the society) and brave to tell the truth (and capable of telling the truth well). In fact, his funeral was a true national funeral, though there was no encouragement from the government since he was still officially a wanted man for his criticizing the government. In the funeral parade, there was a white flag with black words named him as &ldquo;The Sole of China&rdquo;, which, I think, properly reflects the importance of Lu Xun to Chinese people. This is absolutely unusual for a writer, which also means Lu Xun is not simply a writer any more. However, he once said &ldquo;What I wrote is different from what I really thought.&rdquo; and &ldquo;What I wrote for others is different from what I wrote for myself.&rdquo; I think this shows that he was even at a higher level of telling truth. That is, he tried to tell the truth but he recognized that he somehow could not tell the whole truth and he admitted this fact. (Why could not he tell the whole truth? The reasons are complicated and I will write another post about this in details in the future. Here I just provide one reason: he did not want to completely despair young Chinese since the truth perceived by him was too dark to bear, which is basically that there is no bright future at all for China or Chinese people. What a sad perception!)</p>
<p>There are many critics on Lu Xun and his works. I think the best one perhaps is Qian Liqun (钱理群), now a retired professor from Peking University, a real independent thinker standing with the common Chinese people, who has spent his life on studying Lu Xun and might know the value of Lu Xun&rsquo;s spirits and works better than Lu Xun himself. At least I began to understand Lu Xun a lot more after reading Qian Liqun&rsquo;s works. (Interestingly, Qian Liqun criticized Peking University just as Lu Xun criticized China so that Qian Liqun has been isolated since he began to express his true opinions about Peking University and China. At this point, his fate is just like that of Lu Xun.) Of course, Lu Xun and his thoughts might have been made too great and even perfect by all kinds of researchers. Perhaps Lu Xun is not only Lu Xun any more, but a name for a set of deep thoughts and valuable spirits, which, I think, Chinese people should appreciate. Qian Liqun even think that Lu Xun&rsquo;s legacy is as important as that of Confucius and that they are both the most excellent Chinese in thousands of years. I agree with him. However, Lu Xun&rsquo;s thoughts and spirits are not perfect. I think Lu Xun would agree on it. Actually, Lu Xun once said that his thoughts were too dark. This means that Lu Xun did not pay enough attention to the bright aspects of the world. This should be a result of his life experience in that period of time when China suffered a lot from both within and outside. I also want to emphasize that Lu Xun is essentially an independent thinker and brave writer following his conscience but not an excellent doer. Mao Zedong is not only a great thinker but also, more importantly, a great doer and practically made China a really independent nation. I think Chinese people should never forget this point, especially when we criticize Mao.</p>
<p>Next, I provide several photos and one painting of Lu Xun with some comments. They are from Internet.</p>

  <p>Lu Xun with Young Friends<br>

</div>
<p>This photo was taken only eleven days before his death, which was a little unexpected even to himself, though he had already been seriously troubled with health issues. It is notable that his last words for his family and friends are &ldquo;Forget me.&rdquo; According to this, Qian Liqun pointed out that our talking about and studying Lu Xun were actualy against his will. However, I do not agree. In fact, we are not Lu Xun&rsquo;s family and friends so that we could analyze his thoughts and spirits without being emotional. So, we, as a nation, must remember him, since Lu Xun is still dramatically needed for today&rsquo;s China, perhaps forever. That &ldquo;Forget me&rdquo;, I think, was intended to make his family and friends less grievous, which shows his enormous love. On the contrary, Lu Xun&rsquo;s last words for public enemies, those smart elites putting their personal interests before national ones, are &ldquo;No forgiveness.&rdquo;, full of hatred, partially illustrated by the next painting.</p>

  <p>A Painting of Lu Xun</p>
</div>
<p>This is an image of Lu Xun living in the mind of Chinese people, an absolute and undefeatable fighter against the evil aspects of traditional Chinese culture. What he is holding is not a chopstick but a traditional Chinese pen, which in Lu Xun&rsquo;s hand is like a scalpel for the Chinese society already having one foot in the grave. He grew up in the traditional Chinese culture but fought against it, just like Neo in the movie Matrix coming from but fighting against Matrix. Lu Xun was the One of writers for China in the last century. He did make a difference. Will the One return in this century? Is his return necessary? In recent years, it seems that many people hope for and believe in his return. So do I. In fact, I think the One should never leave but always stay on earch.</p>
<p>However, the One is not the final solution, since the One is essentially a destroyer with certain justice. The final solution might be a creator without fundamental flaws. Mao Zedong is a great creator, a person who can really make fundamental changes to a nation, but unfortunately he also has the intrinsic flaw shared by all the great emperors in the Chinese history, which is the desire of completely controlling the highest political power by himself all alone at least in all his life. The reasons should be complicated, not just for his personal benefits. One reason might be that Mao did not believe other political leaders would put national interests before their personal ones. Nevertheless, Mao made questionable decisions with serious consequences in his late life.  To be fair, however, we should understand that Mao Zedong, similar to any great emperor of a dynasty, had to always hold the highest power. Otherwise, his plan for China would be ignored and he and his family would have been persecuted, or even murdered. In fact, his wife somehow was forced to make a suicide not long after his's death and labeled as almost one of the worst women in the Chinese history. So, there is an unsolvable dilemma for capable creators, which is perhaps also the fundamental reason for Lu Xun&rsquo;s desperation for a bright future of China. But Lu Xun could be wrong. At least I hope he was wrong about this desperation.</p>
